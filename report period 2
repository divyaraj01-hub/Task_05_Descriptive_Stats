Next Research Phase Priorities
Phase 3: Advanced Strategic Questions 

Subjective Analysis: "Who was the most improved player?"
Strategic Recommendations: "Should we focus on offense or defense?"
Multi-factor Decision Making: "Which player to develop as game-changer?"
Predictive Insights: "How to win 2 more games next season?"

Expected Challenges:

Metric definition requirements for subjective evaluations
Multiple valid answer possibilities
Need for domain expertise validation
Extensive prompt engineering likely required
