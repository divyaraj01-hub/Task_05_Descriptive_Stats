Key Accomplishments
1. Research Framework Development 

Methodology Design: Created systematic testing framework across three complexity levels:

Phase 1: Basic descriptive questions (expected 90%+ accuracy)
Phase 2: Intermediate analysis questions (expected 70-85% accuracy)
Phase 3: Advanced strategic questions (expected 30-70% accuracy)


Validation Approach: Established methods for verifying LLM accuracy against statistical calculations
Success Metrics: Defined quantitative (accuracy rates) and qualitative (reasoning quality) measures

2. Data Collection Investigation 

Primary Source Attempts: Investigated Syracuse athletics website, ACC conference databases, NCAA statistics
Challenge Documentation: Encountered significant data access limitations due to:

Website authentication requirements
Limited public availability of detailed player statistics
Complex JavaScript interfaces preventing direct data extraction


Alternative Strategy: Identified this as valuable research finding representing real-world LLM application constraints

3. Technical Framework Implementation 

Question Categories: Established progression from simple aggregation to complex strategic analysis
Prompt Engineering Templates: Created structured approaches for different complexity levels
Validation Scripts: Began development of automated verification tools for statistical calculations

4. Documentation and Planning

GitHub Repository: Created repository structure for Task_05_Descriptive_Stats
Research Documentation: Comprehensive methodology and framework documentation
Next Phase Planning: Established clear objectives for Period 2 activities

Challenges and Adaptations
Primary Challenge: Data Access Limitations
Issue: Official Syracuse Women's Lacrosse statistics not readily accessible through public APIs or simple web scraping
Adaptation Strategy:

Pivot to representative dataset approach while maintaining research focus on LLM capabilities
Document data access challenges as part of real-world AI application research
Focus on methodology development that can apply to any similar sports dataset

Research Philosophy
Rather than being blocked by data access issues, adapted the approach to emphasize the core research questions about LLM analytical capabilities, which remain valid regardless of the specific dataset used.
Research Value and Implications
This foundational work establishes a robust framework for evaluating LLM capabilities in sports analytics, with findings that will extend beyond just lacrosse applications. The systematic approach to testing AI reliability in domain-specific analytical tasks addresses critical questions about:

AI trustworthiness in statistical reasoning
Effective prompt engineering for complex analysis
Validation requirements for AI-assisted decision making

Next Period Objectives
