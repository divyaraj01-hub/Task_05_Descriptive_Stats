Research Task 5: Descriptive Statistics and Large Language Models
Project Overview
This research project tests the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately analyze sports statistics data and answer increasingly complex natural language questions about team performance, player evaluation, and strategic recommendations.
Research Question
How reliably can LLMs perform domain-specific analytical tasks on sports data, from simple descriptive statistics to complex strategic coaching decisions?
Dataset

Methodology
Testing Framework
Phase 1: Basic Descriptive Questions (Expected 90%+ accuracy)

Simple counting and aggregation
Direct player stat lookups
Maximum/minimum value identification

Phase 2: Intermediate Analysis (Expected 70-85% accuracy)

Calculated metrics with filtering criteria
Positional group analysis
Comparative statistics

Phase 3: Advanced Strategic Questions (Expected 30-70% accuracy)

Performance improvement analysis
Coaching recommendations
Strategic decision support

Prompt Engineering Levels

Naive Prompts: Direct questions without context
Structured Prompts: Include data context and definitions
Engineered Prompts: Define metrics and calculation methods
Multi-step Prompts: Break complex questions into validated steps



Framework Development: Established systematic testing methodology across 3 complexity levels
Data Access Challenges: Encountered limitations with official Syracuse athletics data sources
Alternative Strategy: Created representative dataset to maintain research momentum
Foundation: Built robust validation and prompt engineering framework

Period 2 Results (August 1-15, 2025)

Phase 1 Testing: Achieved 100% accuracy on basic descriptive questions (8/8 correct)
Phase 2 Testing: [In Progress] Testing intermediate analysis questions
Prompt Engineering: Documenting effective strategies for different question complexities
Validation Scripts: Developed automated verification for statistical calculations

Research Value
This project addresses critical questions about AI reliability in domain-specific analysis, with findings valuable for:

Sports analytics applications
Educational use of AI for statistical reasoning
Understanding LLM limitations in data analysis
Developing best practices for AI-assisted decision making
